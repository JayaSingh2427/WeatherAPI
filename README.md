# WeatherAPI
 A web application built using Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for any location using the OpenWeatherMap API.
This project features custom JavaScript logic to handle user input and display results, and a clean and modern interface with responsive design for optimal viewing on desktop and mobile devices. The use of APIs is a central feature of this project, providing valuable real-time data for users. Created as part of the Udemy course 'The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp' by Angela Yu, this project is a great way to learn about building dynamic web applications with APIs and Node.js.
